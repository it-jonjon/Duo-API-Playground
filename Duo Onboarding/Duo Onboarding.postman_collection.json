		"description": "This collection is designed to help perform some of initial onboarding processes for a new Duo client account. The collection includes requests for creating an account, updating settings, creating integrations, creating and applying policies, enrolling users, and more.\n\nFor more insight into the specific requirements and usage of each collection of requests, please refer to documentation found within each folder.\n\n- Account Setup\n    - Create Account (name the account)\n    - Modify Edition\n    - Modify Settings\n    - Modify Custom Branding\n    - Modify Custom Messaging\n- Application Management\n    - Create Integration\n- User Enrollment\n    - Create Group\n    - Enroll Users\n- Policy Management\n    - Retrieve Global Policy\n    - Update Global Policy\n    - Aplly Policy\n- User Management\n    - Retrieve enrollment status\n    - Assigned enrolled users to group\n- Clean Up\n    - Clear Variables\n        - This request cleans up all of the created global variables\n\n#### 🚀 Getting started with this collection\n\nNote: If you haven't already, head over to the **Accounts API** collection and setup the necessary prerequisites. Once you've complete the prerequistes, please follow the steps below.\n\n**Step 1:** Navigate to **Duo Onboarding** > **Variables** , and input the desired account name under the `newChildAccount` collection variable. Keep the format as \\[\"New Child Account\"\\] and only replace the text within the double quotes and brackets. Example: \\[\"Block Buster\"\\]\n\n**Step 2** (Optional): We've built in a capability that allows you to enroll a CSV list of users. The CSV list should contain two column headers: 'username' and 'email', followed by the respective username and email address of each user you wish to enroll. To define this in the workspace, navigate to **Duo Onboarding** > **Variables** , and input the CSV list to the `usersCsv` variable.\n\n**Step 3**: Each request within the collection has it's own paramater and configuration reqiurements. Please ensure to define these according to your needs before executing each request. For detailed information on what is required, refer to the documentation provided in the corresponding folder of each section, and/or the relevant Duo API documentation.\n\n**Step 4**: Once you've defined the configuratoin according to your requirements, it's best to run the requests in sequential order via the [Collection Runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), however these request can be run individually. Please note, however, that some requests depend on other requests to be run beforehand. Consult the Request Dependency Matrix for further insight.\n\n#### ⚙️ Request Dependency Matrix\n\nThis table provides an overview of the various requests within this collection. It outlines each request, its purpose, and any dependent requests it may rely on for successful execution.\n\n| Request | Description | Dependencies |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Create Account](https://duo.com/docs/accountsapi#create-account) | Creates a new Duo customer account | None |\n| [Modify Edition](https://duo.com/docs/accountsapi#set-edition) | Sets the effective Duo edition for a child account | Create Account |\n| [Modify Settings](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#modify-settings) | Change global Duo settings | Create Account |\n| [Modify Custom Branding](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#modify-live-custom-branding) | Change effective custom branding settings | Create Account |\n| [Modify Custom Messaging](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#modify-custom-messaging) | Updates current custom messaging settings, shown to users in the Universal Prompt | Create Account |\n| [Create Integration A](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#create-integration) | Creates a new integration.

Some variables are dynamically generated during API calls, while others need to be manually configured.\n\nSee [Using Variables](https://learning.postman.com/collection-format/advanced-concepts/variables/) for further insight on variable use in Postman\n\n| Variable Name | Description | Scope |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| accounts_api_ikey | Your Accounts API Integration Key. This needs to be manually set in the global variables. | Global |\n| accounts_api_skey | Your Accounts API Secret Key. This needs to be manually set in the global variables. | Global |\n| accounts_api_host | Your Accounts API Hostname. This needs to be manually set in the global variables. | Global |\n| newChildAccount | Defines the name of the new Duo account. | Collection |\n| usersCsv | Defines a CSV list for user enrollment, containing 'username' and 'email' for each entry. | Collection |",

			"description": "The 'Policy Managment' folder in the 'Duo Onboarding' collection provides a set of requests designed to define and assign policies to the newly created Duo account.\n\nPolicy configuration and assignment can be complex, but understanding the core functionality of Duo's policy engine and how these policies work together will help in defining granular policy definitions to meet your customer's security needs. If you aren't familiar with Duo's policy stack, please refer to our [Policy and Control](https://duo.com/docs/policy) documentation for further insight. Doing so will help defining the policies within this API playground much more intutive.\n\nWithin the workspace, we are using the following endpoints to pull, create, and update policies.\n\n- Retrieve Policies - Retrieve a complete set of all policies. Includes all [policy section data](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#policy-section-data) for each policy.\n- Create Policy - Creates a new custom policy with the `name` specified in the parameters.\n- Update Policy - Change an existing policy's `name`, add or remove policy `sections`, or update keys/values for the policy with the specified policy_key\n    - If you add a new policy `section` to a custom policy then the API enables the section (that is, makes it active in the policy) and sets the valid values you specify. Any key/value pairs not specified for the section will be set to their default values. If you add a blank policy section, it will be enabled for the policy with default values.If you modify values for an existing policy `section` then the API changes only the values you specify.\n\n#### Defining Policies\n\nWhile other requests in this workspace use the Params section of the request to define the parameters to be sent to the Duo API, the /policy endpoint accepts the parameters in the body of the request. See the [Duo Admin API - Policy](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#policy) documentation for further insight.\n\nTo make defining polcies as simple as possible within the workspace, we have included several policy templates below. However, if you would like to define more granular and specic policy options, please update the policy sections according to our [Policy Sections Data](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#policy-section-data) as appropriate for your client's needs.\n\n#### Example Policy Section Data (Do not use)\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"sections\": {\n

Add the account_id under global variables of the account you want to check. This output can be obtained from the response in the Retrieve Accounts request under the Duo Accounts API collection.\n2. Add the newChildAccount variable at the top of the collection, this will be the name of the child account that you want to check. This will be formatted as follows \\[\"New Child Account\"\\], replace the name of the child account with the current name that is attached to the Account ID.\n3. You should now be able to run the collection by itself."
